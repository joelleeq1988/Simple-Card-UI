<p><strong><h3 style="background-color:Gray">CAREER OBJECTIVES</h3></strong></p>
                <meta charset="UTF-8">
                <p>I am seeking for a job in an organization that will benefit from my IT skills and will offer me a constructive workplace for communicating and interacting with clients and job providers. I am ecstatic and excited at the prospect of bringing my skills and talents to your company and I believe my experience in this field makes me an ideal candidate for your open position.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;I already have experienced working virtually since 2013 as a data entry and customer service representative. I also have experience working as a credit repair specialist for more than a year, and my task includes processing dispute letters and sending them to the credit reporting agencies through Letterstream and CFPB.</p>
                <p>I believe that I would be a valuable addition to your company. And I am confident that I can fulfill every task the company has to give.</p>
                <p>I am always open to improvements and constructive criticism since it will allow me to learn and grow and help me to give a new perspective and open my eyes to things I may have overlooked or never considered. And it will give me the opportunities to become better workers and people</p>
                <p>I can be of good help in your business as you will be to me.</p>
